/******************************************************************************
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * if bootstrap is included here, then remove / reorder '= require_tree .'
 *  and '= require_self' to allow other SASS files to access bootstrap vars
 *=require jquery-ui/core
 *=require jquery-ui/theme
 *=require_tree .
 *=require_self
